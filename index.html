                    <p>An important benefit of an office automation system is the ability
                        to design and improve workflows. The solution that you choose
                        should give you the ability to create detailed workflows in a
                        matter of minutes. Leading solutions offer an intuitive design
                        and include features like a drag and drop process modeler.</p>

                    <p>Before implementing an office automation system, the organization
                        will need to spend time looking at which specific processes will
                        need to be automated. Begin by looking at existing workflows to
                        gain an understanding of the processes, stakeholders, and resources
                        involved. One of the easiest ways to go about examining your
                        workflows is through process mapping.</p>

                    <span>Office Administrator</span>
                    <span class="name">Company name</span>
                    <p>Business process mapping involves creating a visual representation
                        of work processes to define what an organization does, how it does
                        it, and who is responsible for each task. Many processes within an
                        organization are undocumented. By creating visual depictions,
                        stakeholders can identify bottlenecks in workflows and tasks that
                        need streamlining. Creating a process map is simple with the drag
                        and drop process modeler features of industry leading business
                        process management software.</p>

                    <p>There are countless applications and software programs that promise improved
                        efficiency through automation. As we discussed above, however, achieving
                        organizational efficiency through an office automation system requires
                        more than downloading a few apps. Rather, you need a comprehensive office
